## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Git

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iTransfer.git
cd iTransfer
```

2. Configure the application in `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
services:
  frontend:
    # ... other settings ...
    environment:
      # Local development
      - BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5500
      
  backend:
    # ... other settings ...
    environment:
      # Database settings
      - DATABASE_URL=mysql+mysqldb://itransfer:your_db_password@db/itransfer
      
      # Admin access (change these!)
      - ADMIN_USERNAME=your_admin_username
      - ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_admin_password
      
      # Local development
      - FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3500
      - BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5500
      
  db:
    # ... other settings ...
    environment:
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=itransfer
      - MYSQL_USER=itransfer
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_db_password
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_root_password
```

3. Start the application:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

4. Access the application:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3500
- Backend API: http://localhost:5500

### SMTP Configuration

1. Log in to the admin interface at http://localhost:3500/admin
2. Configure your SMTP settings:
   - SMTP Server (e.g., smtp.gmail.com)
   - SMTP Port (587 for STARTTLS, 465 for SSL)
   - SMTP Username
   - SMTP Password
   - Sender Email

The application will automatically detect the correct protocol based on the port:
- Port 465: Uses SSL
- Port 587 (or others): Uses STARTTLS

### Production Deployment

For production deployment behind a reverse proxy, update your `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  frontend:
    # ... other settings ...
    environment:
      # Production URL (with https)
      - BACKEND_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
      
  backend:
    # ... other settings ...
    environment:
      # Production settings
      - FRONTEND_URL=https://yourdomain.com
      - BACKEND_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
      - FORCE_HTTPS=true
      - PROXY_COUNT=1  # Number of reverse proxies
      
      # Security (change these!)
      - ADMIN_USERNAME=secure_admin_username
      - ADMIN_PASSWORD=secure_admin_password
      
      # Database (use strong passwords)
      - DATABASE_URL=mysql+mysqldb://itransfer:strong_db_password@db/itransfer
      
  db:
    # ... other settings ...
    environment:
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=itransfer
      - MYSQL_USER=itransfer
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=strong_db_password
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=strong_root_password
```

Configure your reverse proxy (example for Nginx):
```nginx
# Frontend
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name yourdomain.com;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3500;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}

# Backend
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name api.yourdomain.com;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5500;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

Start the application:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
